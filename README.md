# File table demo

This demo shows a table where every row is a file that can be selected and downloaded.

It's a frontend demo developed with React.js. It doesn't include style frameworks like Material-UI.

It uses functional tests with Cypress. There is no complete test coverage as it's not necessary for demo purposes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cypress:open`

Opens the [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) application with functional tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
